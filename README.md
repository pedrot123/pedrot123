Hi, I’m a computer science student at Rutgers University and have a strong passion for tech-related things. I am skilled in Java, Python, HTML, CSS, Linux/Mac CLI, and more. I took two years of Comp Sci classes in High School. I like to work on personal projects and want to explore AI/ML and its applications in the medical field. Over the next few months, I want to learn PyTorch, Django, and C++.
